# Life Balance Hub

**Life Balance Hub** is a calm digital space designed to support balance between mind, body, and modern life.

This project explores how mindfulness, meditation, sound, and nature-inspired design can coexist with modern technology—without pressure, overstimulation, or social comparison.

The website is built as a simple, static platform using GitHub Pages, focusing on clarity, calm user experience, and gentle self-reflection.
